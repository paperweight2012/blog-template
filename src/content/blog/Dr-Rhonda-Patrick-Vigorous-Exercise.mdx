- Zone 2 is 70-80% of MHR
- Vigorous exercise: Above lactate threshold. 80-85% of MHR
- Zone 4 training 85-90%
- Zone 5 >90%
- VO2 Max is correlated with longevity
- HIIT for increasing VO2 Max
- Zone 2 itself might not increase VO2 Max
- Adding vigorous to Zone 2 increases VO2 Max
- For "normal" exercisers need more than 80/20 for Zone 2 vs. higher intensity
- Sub 10 hr/week 50% HIIT
- Different types:
  - Tabata 20s/10s/8x
  - Wingate 30s/4m/4-6x
  - Conventional 60s/60s/10x
  - Clinical 4m/3m/4x
- Cooper test. 12min run test
- Mitochondrial efficiency goes down w age. So, increase number of mito. Best way is vigorous exercise
- Lactate produced by vigorous exercise triggers mitochondrial biogenesis
- Zone 2 also does it
- Mitophagy increases w vigorous. Maybe also zone 2.
- Lactate brain. More lactate means less glucose used in brain. Glucose is used in the production of glutathione
- \#BDNF "youth elixir"
- Shear stress in blood is increased with HIIT. And that kills circulating tumor cells
- Exercise snacks before and after meals
- \#VILPA vigorous intensity lifestyle physical activity. Sprinting up stairs etc
