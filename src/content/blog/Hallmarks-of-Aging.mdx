title: Hallmarks of Aging
---

After Covid, I started reading a lot of books on aging. I was coming across hallmarks of aging in various places. I kept forgetting them. So, put them in one place for me to remember.

I think it started with 9. Now in many places I see 12. The following are my own rewording. So, you might not find something exactly the same as the ones below.

[Hallmarks of Aging from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallmarks_of_aging)
