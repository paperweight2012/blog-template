## Magdalena River of Dreams

[Wade Davis](https://www.amazon.com/Magdalena-Story-Colombia-Wade-Davis/dp/073527892X/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&dib_tag=se&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.lxgILpXSnRBqwaEB_1IeCFNzJeEv5YPuq9vKOGBbjoiKkmKdACeNG89HXrSnQkplFRNk7WR0GAkUld_HhD2amQ.rHFRP2_HlcpYz2fNUjhr_fvYL42-Vqfcki9Q3ENUJ_o&qid=1715409097&sr=8-1) talks about Colombia, its history, politics, and culture, through a trip down Magdalena, which traverses the entire length of the country. He starts at the source of the river and follows it all the way to the mouth. And in so doing tells the tale of the whole country. Its wildernesses. Its more distant past. Colonial days. Bolivar. More recent political issues. The terror of the mid-20th century. Cocaine troubles. Music and culture. And, of course ,Gabo.

The river is named after Mary Magdalene. I always thought she was a prostitute. However, as I learned from this book, she was not. And [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Magdalene#Portrayal_as_a_prostitute) is what Wikipedia says. She was the first disciple who saw Jesus when he was resurrected.

I've read a couple of books by him. Always thought he was an interesting writer. I really loved this book. Learned a lot. The writing is beautiful and somehow captures the beauty (or at least what I imagine it to be) of Colombia. Made me want to read Gabriel Garcia Marquez again. _The general in his labyrinth, Love in the time of cholera, One hundred years of solitude_
I was not annotating this book as I read it. So, no quotes from this one.
