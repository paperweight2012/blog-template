			<p>
				I have a diverse background spanning engineering, sales, consulting, and marketing
				leadership. My journey started in engineering, but I quickly found my passion for business
				strategy and AI-driven solutions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Throughout my career, I've led global teams, driven business transformations, and helped
				companies scale through data-driven marketing and strategic alliances. From working at
				McKinsey to leading AI-driven marketing initiatives at 8x8, I thrive in high-impact roles
				that align strategy with execution.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm always excited by opportunities that challenge me to solve complex problems, bring teams
				together, and drive meaningful growth. Whether in startups or large enterprises, my focus
				remains on innovation, execution, and delivering results.
